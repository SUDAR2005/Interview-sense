    "question": "Easy: Given a sorted array of integers, find two numbers that add up to a specific target value. Return the indices of the two numbers. Assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. Array is 1-indexed.",
    "Sample 1": [
      {
        "input": "numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9",
        "output": "[1,2]"
      }
    ],
    "Sample 2": [
      {
        "input": "numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6",
        "output": "[1,3]"
      }
    ],
    "Explanation": "Use two pointers, one starting from the beginning and the other from the end of the array. Move the pointers based on whether the sum of the numbers they point to is less than or greater than the target."

  {
    "question": "Medium: Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.",       
    "Sample 1": [
      {
        "input": "s = 'abcabcbb'",
        "output": "3"
      }
    ],
    "Sample 2": [
      {
        "input": "s = 'bbbbb'",
        "output": "1"
      }
    ],
    "Explanation": "Use a sliding window approach with two pointers and a set to keep track of the characters in the current window. Expand the window until a repeating character is found, then shrink the window from the left until the repeating character is removed."

  {
    "question": "Hard: You are given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively. Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).",
    "Sample 1": [
      {
        "input": "nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]",
        "output": "2.00000"
      }
    ],
    "Sample 2": [
      {
        "input": "nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]",
        "output": "2.50000"
      }
    ],
    "Explanation": "This can be solved with a modified binary search approach. Partition both arrays such that the number of elements on the left side of the partitions is equal to (m+n+1)/2. Then, compare the max element on the left of each partition to the min element on the right of the other partition to determine the median."
